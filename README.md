## Abstract

   This document defines a YANG model for configuring and managing WDM
   tunnels in fixed- and flexi-grid optical networks, built on traffic-engineering (TE) topology information as defined
   in the WSON (RFC9094), flexi-grid (draft-ietf-ccamp-flexigrid-yang), and optical impairment (draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology) topology models.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).
